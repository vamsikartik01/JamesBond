This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Description:
The Smart Home Frontend Service is a modern and dynamic web application developed using Angular, designed to offer an intuitive and seamless user experience for controlling and managing smart home devices. The service seamlessly communicates with a Golang backend, utilizing a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Key Features:

1. User-friendly Interface: The application boasts a user-friendly and responsive interface, providing a smooth and visually engaging experience across various devices and screen sizes.

2. Golang Backend Integration: The Angular frontend is integrated with a robust Golang backend service, ensuring efficient data exchange and synchronization between the user interface and the backend server.

3. Device Control and Management: Users can effortlessly control a wide range of smart home devices, such as lights, thermostats, smart plugs, and more, from a centralized dashboard. The service offers intuitive controls for turning devices on/off.

4. Real-time Updates: Leveraging modern web technologies, the frontend service utilizes WebSockets or other real-time communication methods to provide instant updates on device status changes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

5. MySQL Database: The application uses a MySQL database for reliable data storage, enabling the backend service to store and retrieve information related to user preferences, device settings, and historical data.

6. Continuous Integration and Deployment: The development process is streamlined with Amazon's CodePipeline, facilitating continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices. This ensures smooth and automated updates to the frontend, improving development efficiency and maintaining a consistently up-to-date application.

7. Scalable Architecture: The application is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy addition of new smart devices and accommodating a growing user base without compromising performance.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
